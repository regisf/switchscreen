INSTALL switchscreen
====================

Preambule
---------

In some case, other program may observe the screen configuration like krandrtray
Be sure to disable it before testing switchscreen.

To know your xrandr configuration open a shell and type ($ is the shell prompt):
    $ xrandr
Something like that will appear:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 1024, maximum 8192 x 8192
    LVDS1 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
       1366x768       59.6 +
       1360x768       59.8     60.0  
       1024x768       60.0  
       800x600        60.3     56.2  
       640x480        59.9  
    VGA1 connected 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 338mm x 270mm
       1280x1024      60.0*+
       1024x768       75.1     70.1     60.0  
       800x600        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2  
       640x480        72.8     75.0     60.0  
       720x400        70.1  

This means:
    Screen 0 is the default screen. The first in the list bellow.
    
    LVDS1 is connected but not active (see star in VGA1). The prefered
    resolution is 1366x768 at 59.6 Hz. It can handle resolutions 1360x768,
    1024x768, 800x600 and 640x480.
    
    VGA1 is connected and active (see the star?). The prefered resolution is
    1280x1024 at 60 Hz. The star indicate the current resolution. It can handle
    resolutions 1280x1024, 1024x768, 800x600, 640x480, 720x400.
    
Open the switchscreenrc.sample  with a text editor and change screen resolution
and default screen. Those configuration are mine. The configuration file is
eavy commented.
Save the file as .switchscreenrc in your home directory.

Test only
---------

Start in a shell and type:
    $ ./switchscreen.py -no-daemon
    
Unplug your external screen. It works ! If not, please send me a email.

Home directory
--------------

Either you copy the switchscreen script in your ~/bin directory, either you
can use setup.py with:
    $ python setup.py install --prefix=~

Global
------

Open a shell and type:
    $ su -c "python setup.py install"
    or
    $ sudo python setup.py install

Crash
-----

In some case xrandr or XWindow (I don't really know) Crash. Open a TTY shell
with Ctrl+Alt+F1, log into it and type:
    $ sudo killall kdm && sudo kdm &
    or
    $ su -c "killall kdm && kdm &"
    
to restart your XWindow system. GNOME use might use gdm instead of kdm.
